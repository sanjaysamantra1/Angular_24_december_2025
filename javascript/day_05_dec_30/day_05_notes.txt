functions
=========
1. Function Declaration
2. Function Expression
3. Self invoked
4. Arrow Function



Function Declaration vs Function Expression
============================================
1. Function Declarations are named , Function Expressions are anonymous
2. Function Declarations are hoisted, Function Expressions are not hoisted


Q. Write a program to calculate simple interest


Self Invoked Function
=====================
-Immediately Invoked Function Expression ( IIFE )
-these functions can be invoked only 1
-To Execute something on page load.


Arrow Function
==============
-compact syntaxt
-implicit return
-no function keyword
-no body {} 
-doesn't have its own 'this' , uses 'this' from lexical/outer scope
-in arrow function, 'this' is static


'this' in function
==================
Regular : 'this' - how/where the function is called
Arrow : 'this' - where the function is written




Arrow Function Limitations
==========================
1. arrow functions shouldn't be used as object methods
2. arrow functions shouldn't be used if we expect 'this' value to be dynamic inside a function.


Regular Function Limitations
============================
